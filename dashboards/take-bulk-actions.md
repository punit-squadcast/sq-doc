# Take Bulk Actions

Bulk actions help you change the incident states of multiple incidents at one go

Bulk actions are a way for you to change the Incident Statuses for multiple incidents at one shot. You can do this by following the steps below.

**(1)** Pick a **Team** from the team picker on the top of the screen. Move over to the status-wise filters in the **Incident Dashboard**. Click on the incident state for which you need the incidents either **Acknowledged** or **Resolved**.

In this example, we have clicked on the **Triggered** state and will be moving these incidents to the **Acknowledged** state.

**(2)** Check the box under the **Actions** button to select **all** the incidents that are shown in the view. You can also choose to select specific incidents for which you want to take the action.

**(3)** Click on the **Actions** dropdown and select the new incident state that you want the selected incidents to reflect. In this example, we are choosing **Acknowledge**.

**(4)** This will then open a pop-up with the details of the incidents that are selected. You can review and then click **Confirm & Acknowledge**.

Now, the selected incidents will reflect the new incident state.

Similarly, you can choose to do this to incidents in the **Acknowledged** state as well.
