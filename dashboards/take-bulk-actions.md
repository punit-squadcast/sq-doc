# Take Bulk Actions

Bulk actions are a way for you to change the Incident Statuses for multiple incidents at one shot. You can do this by following the steps below.

**(1)** Pick a **Team** from the team picker on the top of the screen. Move over to the status-wise filters in the **Incident Dashboard**. Click on the incident state for which you need the incidents either **Acknowledged** or **Resolved**.

In this example, we have clicked on the **Triggered** state and will be moving these incidents to the **Acknowledged** state.

**(2)** Check the box under the **Actions** button to select **all** the incidents that are shown in the view. You can also choose to select specific incidents for which you want to take the action.

Now, the selected incidents will reflect the new incident state.

Similarly, you can choose to do this to incidents in the **Acknowledged** state as well.

**Note:**

When you delete a service, you will have to ensure that there are no incidents in the <mark style="color:red;">`Triggered`</mark> or <mark style="color:red;">`Acknowledged`</mark> states. All incidents should be <mark style="color:red;">`Resolved`</mark>.
