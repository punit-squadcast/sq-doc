# Create Incident Manually

Tigger incidents manually

Incidents can be triggered manually either from the **Incident Dashboard** or the **Incident** page.

First, select the **Team** from the team picker on the top.

Click on **+** right next to the **Actions** dropdown tab

#### Triggering Incidents in the **Incidents** page <a href="#triggering-incidents-in-the-incidents-page" id="triggering-incidents-in-the-incidents-page"></a>

**(1)** Click on **Create an Incident**

**(2)** Add details in the relevant fields:

* **Incident Title** - This would be the title/message of the incident being created
* **Incident Description** - This would be the description of the Incident being created. This is an optional field.
* **Service** - Select the relevant **Service** to which this incident would be mapped
* **Assigned To** - Upon choosing the **Service**, the default **Escalation Policy** associated with the **Service** would be auto-filled. You can choose to manually update the **Assigned To** field to a different **Escalation Policy** or a specific **User** or **Squad** in your Team
* **Tags**
* By default, you will have the option to add **Tags** to an incident (either while creating the incident or after the incident is created)

* You can also add multiple tags by clicking on the **+** option
* Adding a **Tag** is optional
