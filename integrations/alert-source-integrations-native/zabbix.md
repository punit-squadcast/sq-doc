# Zabbix

This document will help you integrate Zabbix with Squadcast.

[Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) is a mature, enterprise-level platform that allows you to monitor large-scale IT environments comprising servers, networks, applications and services. Route detailed monitoring alerts from Zabbix to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Zabbix with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Zabbix as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

![](../../.gitbook/assets/alert\_source\_1.png)

**(2)** Search for **Zabbix** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_1.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Zabbix: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** Navigate to Zabbix’s `AlertScriptsPath` directory. This is usually `/etc/zabbix/alert.d` or `/usr/local/share/zabbix/alertscripts`. Check your `zabbix\_server.conf` file to see how this option is configured.

**(2)** In this directory, run the following command:

```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squadcastHub/squadcast-zabbix-script/master/sq-zabbix.py
```

Once the file is downloaded, ensure that it has _executable permissions for your Zabbix user_. If not then please provide the same using the following command:

```
chmod +x sq-zabbix.py
```

\{{site.data.alerts.red-note\}} **Important**\
\


The Squadcast script for Zabbix requires Python 3 to be installed on the machine running Zabbix. Any other version of Python (other than Python 3) will not support this script.

**(3)** Head over to the **Administration** tab and then click on **Media types**. Click on **Create Media type** to create a new Media Type with the following configuration

```
Name: Squadcast 
AlertType: Script
Script Name: sq-zabbix.py
Script Parameters:
    {ALERT.SENDTO}
    {ALERT.SUBJECT}
    {ALERT.MESSAGE}
```

Additionally, ensure **Enabled** checkbox is selected and then click on **Add**

**(4)** Now you can add this Media Type to any User/s of Zabbix. To do so, navigate to **Administration** tab and select **Users** from the drop-down. Here, select **Media** tab and click on **Add**

* _Type_: Either pick Squadcast or add a name, such as _Squadcast_
* _Send to_: Paste the copied Zabbix Webhook URL from Squadcast
* _When active_: Specify suitable values
* _Use if severity_: Select appropriate checkboxes
* Click on **Add** to save the Media for the User

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_3.png)

**(5)** Make sure you click on **Update** button in the **Media** page to save these details

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_4.png)

**(6)** Navigate to the **Configuration** tab and click on **Actions**. Click on **Create Action** and enter a meaningful name, such as **Squadcast Notifications**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_5.png)

**(7)** Switch to **Operations**" tab on the same page and configure the parameters as per your requirements

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_6.png)

Copy-paste the following in the ‘Default Message’ field:

```yaml
name:{TRIGGER.NAME}
id:{TRIGGER.ID}
status:{TRIGGER.STATUS}
hostname:{HOSTNAME}
ip:{IPADDRESS}
value:{TRIGGER.VALUE}
event_id:{EVENT.ID}
severity:{TRIGGER.SEVERITY}
url:{TRIGGER.URL}
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_7.png)

**(8)** Similarly, switch to **Recovery operations** tab and configure the following: Copy-paste the following in the ‘Default Message’ field:

```yaml
name:{TRIGGER.NAME}
id:{TRIGGER.ID}
status:{TRIGGER.STATUS}
hostname:{HOSTNAME}
ip:{IPADDRESS}
value:{TRIGGER.VALUE}
event_id:{EVENT.ID}
severity:{TRIGGER.SEVERITY}
url:{TRIGGER.URL}
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/zabbix\_8.png)

**(9)** Finally click on **Add** to save **Squadcast Notifications**

That's it, our Zabbix integration is now good to go! Whenever Zabbix fires an alert, an incident is created in Squadcast for the same.

\{{site.data.alerts.blue-note\}} **FAQ:**\
\


Q: If an alert gets resolved in Zabbix, does Zabbix send auto-resolve signals to Squadcast?\
\
A: Yes, Zabbix sends alert auto-resolve signals to Squadcast, thus supporting auto-resolution of incidents in Squadcast.

\{{site.data.alerts.blue-note\}} **Important**\
\


The user whose **media** is configured to send alerts to Squadcast must belong to a **user-group** having read permission on the **Host Group** which needs to be monitored by Squadcast inorder to send the alerts.
