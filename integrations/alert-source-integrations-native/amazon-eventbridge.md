Send alerts to Squadcast from Amazon EventBridge

[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) is a serverless event bus that makes it easier to build event-driven applications at scale using events generated from your applications, integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services.

Route detailed alerts from Amazon EventBridge to the right users in Squadcast.
