This document will help you integrate GitLab with Squadcast.

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and continuous integration and deployment pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.

Route detailed events from GitLab to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate GitLab with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using GitLab as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **GitLab** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %} 
<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

### In GitLab: Create a Squadcast Webhook

You can configure a Webhook for a group or a project.

**(1)** In your project or group, on the left sidebar, select **Settings > Webhooks**

**(2)** In the placeholder for **URL**, paste the previously copied Webhook from Squadcast

**(3)** In the **Trigger** section, select the **below events** to trigger the Webhook. Then, select **Add webhook**
 + `Issues`
 + `Pushes`
 + `Merge Requests`
 + `Releases`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** 

This integration supports the below GitLab events: 
 + `Issues` (Supports auto-resolution)
 + `Pushes`
 + `Merge Requests` (Supports auto-resolution)
 + `Releases`
{% endhint %}

That is it, you are good to go! 

Everytime an Issue, Push, Merge Request or a Release event occurs in GitLab, an incident would be created for it in Squadcast. When an Issue or a Merge Request is closed/merged in GitLab, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved**. For Pushes and Releases, the associated incidents must be manually resolved in Squadcast.
