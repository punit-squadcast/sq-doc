[Checkly](https://checklyhq.com/) is an API monitoring and synthetic monitoring solution aimed at development and operations teams, giving teams a broad, deep and exact control over how APIs and web apps should be monitored.
Route detailed monitoring alerts from Checkly to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Checkly with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Checkly as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Checkly** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

![](../../.gitbook/assets/checkly\_1.png)

{% hint style="info" %} 
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

### In Checkly: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** In the app, navigate to **Alert Settings** on the sidebar

**(4)** Fill in the details as indicated below:

  **(a)** Give it a meaningful name, such as *Squadcast Webhook*
  
  
  **(b)** Choose **POST** from the **Method** drop-down and paste the Webhook URL copied from Squadcast in the **URL** placeholder
  
  **(c)** Copy and paste the below template in **Body**
{% raw %}
```json
{
    "check_name": "{{CHECK_NAME}}",
    "check_id": "{{CHECK_ID}}",
    "check_type": "{{CHECK_TYPE}}",
    "message": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
    "alert_type": "{{ALERT_TYPE}}",
    "check_result_id": "{{CHECK_RESULT_ID}}",
    "response_time": "{{RESPONSE_TIME}}",
    "api_check_response_status_code": "{{API_CHECK_RESPONSE_STATUS_CODE}}",
    "api_check_response_status_text": "{{API_CHECK_RESPONSE_STATUS_TEXT}}",
    "run_location": "{{RUN_LOCATION}}",
    "link": "{{RESULT_LINK}}",
    "ssl_days_remaining": "{{SSL_DAYS_REMAINING}}",
    "ssl_check_domain": "{{SSL_CHECK_DOMAIN}}",
    "started_at": "{{STARTED_AT}}",
    "tags": [{{#each TAGS}} "{{this}}" {{#unless @last}},{{/unless}} {{/each}}],
    "region": "{{REGION}}",
    "uuid": "{{$UUID}}",
    "random_number": "{{$RANDOM_NUMBER}}"
}
```
{% endraw %}

**Important:**

**(1)** Checkly auto-reformats the content copied from above that you paste which ruptures the template syntax, resulting in the failure of the **Test webhook** option and hence, alert propagation to Squadcast. Please ensure the copied content is edited to match the syntax in the screenshot below.

**(2)** It is recommended to add the **Header** `Content-Type` as `application/json`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/checkly\_7.png)
{% endhint %}
  
  **(d)** Now, you can verify if the integration works fine by clicking on **Test webhook** which will create an incident in Squadcast
  
  **(e)** In the **Send when** section, choose **`a check fails`**, **`a check recovers`** without fail. The other two options, **`a check degrades`** and **`an SSL certificate is due to expire in a few days`** are optional, based on your requirement
  
  **(f)** Select the `checks` and `groups` that you want to add to this webhook channel as **Subscribers**
  
  **(g)** **Save webhook** configuration

That is it, you are now good to go! Whenever an alert is triggered in Checkly, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast. When an alert is resolved in Checkly, the corresponding incident will get **auto-resolved in Squadcast.**
