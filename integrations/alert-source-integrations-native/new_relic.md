This document will help you integrate New Relic with Squadcast.

[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) is an observability platform built to help engineers create more perfect software. From monoliths to serverless, you can instrument everything, then analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your entire software stack, all from one place.

Route detailed monitoring alerts from New Relic to the right users in Squadcast.

{% hint style="warning" %} 
<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

- Select where you want to **receive notifications** 
    + Select **Webhook**

    {% raw %}
    ```json
    {
        "alertClass": "anomaly_detection",
        "alertData": {{this}}
    }

Now, every time there is an alert in New Relic, the alert will be sent to Squadcast and an incident will be triggered, notifying the right people. 

Similarly, when the alert gets resolved in New Relic, the corresponding incident will get **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.
