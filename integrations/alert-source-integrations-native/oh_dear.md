# Oh Dear

[Oh Dear](https://ohdear.app/) is a monitoring tool which monitors uptime, SSL certificates, broken links, scheduled tasks, application health, DNS and more.

Route detailed alerts from Oh Dear to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Oh Dear as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Alert in Oh Dear

**(1)** Login to your Oh Dear dashboard. Head over to the **Account** settings and click on **Team Notifications**

That's it, you are good to go! Your Oh Dear integration is now complete. Whenever Oh Dear fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. Also, when an alert is resolved in Oh Dear, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
