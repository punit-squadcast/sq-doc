{% hint style="info" %} 
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

### In ManageEngine Application Manager: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**Important:**

Understanding how the integration works:

- Trigger a new incident:
For the values `severity: critical`, `severity: down`, `severity: warning` in the alert payload, an incident is triggered in Squadcast.

- Resolve an existing incident:
For the values `severity: clear` and `severity: up`, incidents are resolved in Squadcast (pertaining to auto-resolution of an existing, open incident)

Please ensure that the right `severity` is being sent within the payload for the alerts into Squadcast. If values other than the ones mentioned above are sent for `severity`, the integration will not work as expected.

In case of any queries, please feel free to reach out to our [Support team](mailto:support@squadcast.com).

{% endhint %}

That's it, you are good to go! Your ManageEngine Application Manager integration is now complete.

Now, whenever ManageEngine Application Manager fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. When the alert recovers in ManageEngine Application Manager, the corresponding incident will **automatically get resolved** in Squadcast as well.
