Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to push related alert data from StatusCake onto Squadcast.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using StatusCake as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="warning" %} 
<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in StatusCake

1.Login to your StatusCake web console and under **Alerting** click **New Contact Group**

<b>Supported Monitoring Alerts</b>
<br/><br/><p>Alerts from Uptime Monitoring, Page Speed Monitoring, SSL Monitoring, Virus Monitoring and Server Monitoring are currently supported</p>
{% endhint %}

Now whenever an event is triggered in StatusCake, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast. And for **Uptime Monitoring** once the event that triggered the incident(s) is resolved in StatusCake, the relevant Squadcast incidents created would get resolved automatically.
