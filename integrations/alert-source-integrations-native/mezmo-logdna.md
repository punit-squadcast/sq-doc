Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from LogDNA. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Create a LogDNA service in Squadcast

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="info" %} 
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

## Setting Squadcast webhooks in LogDNA

Login to your LogDNA account and navigate to the view for which you want to setup alerts.

On the View name, click on the dropdown and select **Attach an alert**.

That's it! Your LogDNA integration is good to go and whenever the alert conditions are met, an incident will be automatically created in Squadcast.
