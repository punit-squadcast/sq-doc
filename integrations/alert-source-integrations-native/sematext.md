# Sematext

This document will help you integrate Sematext with Squadcast.

[Sematext](https://sematext.com/) allows you to detect and troubleshoot production & performance issues with logs, metrics, synthetic and real user monitoring. Route detailed monitoring alerts from Sematext to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Sematext with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Sematext as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Sematext: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** Go to **Alerts** from the left navigation panel. Click on **Notification Hooks** and select **Squadcast** to create a new Squadcast notification hook

A: No, Sematext does not send auto-resolve signals to Squadcast. Hence, Squadcast incidents from Sematext should be resolved manually.
