# Scout APM

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Scout APM. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using Scout APM as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Scout APM** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create Squadcast Webhook in Scout APM

Go to your Scout APM dashboard and select Alerts & Notifications under the company name.

Then go to the \*\*Notification Groups \*\*and add **Squadcast webhook** to the **Default** notification group or create a new notification group and add to it.

Then you can add this \*\*Notification channel \*\*to an **Alert condition** and whenever the alert is fired, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast.

The Scout APM integration comes with an **Auto-Resolve** feature, meaning that whenever the alerts gets resolved in Scout APM, the incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
