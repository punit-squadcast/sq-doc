Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Scout APM. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Scout APM as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="warning" %} 
<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

Then you can add this **Notification channel **to an **Alert condition** and whenever the alert is fired, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast.

The Scout APM integration comes with an **Auto-Resolve** feature, meaning that whenever the alerts gets resolved in Scout APM, the incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
