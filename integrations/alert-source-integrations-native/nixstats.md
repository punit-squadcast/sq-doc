# Nixstats

This document will help you integrate Nixstats with Squadcast.

[Nixstats](https://nixstats.com/) helps keep track of your servers infrastructure usage, performance and downtime issues in addition to monitoring website uptime.

Route detailed monitoring alerts from Nixstats to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Nixstats with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Nixstats as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Nixstats** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Nixstats: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** From your home page, click on the _Alerts_ tab on the top

**(2)** Switch to the _Contacts_ tab and click on \* +New Contact\*

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nixstats\_3.png)

**(3)** Enter a name for the Contact in the _Name_ field and scroll down a little. Under _Webhook URL_, paste the Nixstats webhook copied from Squadcast

**Configuring Alerts for Server Monitoring**

**(1)** Within the _Alerts_ page, switch to the _Alerts_ tab. Here, you can either create a new Alert or modify your existing Alerts to send notifications to Squadcast via the previously configured Webhook URL.

**(2)** Make sure to add the Squadcast Webhook under _Alert Recipients_. Repeat the same for all your other Alerts

**(3)** In the same window, click on _Show Advanced Options_. Here, enable both the `Alert Opens` and `Alert Closes` checkboxes as shown in the screenshot below and click on `Save`

Now, every time there is an alert for your server in Nixstats, the alert will be sent to Squadcast and an incident will be triggered, notifying the right people. Similarly, if the alert gets resolved within Nixstats, it will get **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.

**Configuring Monitors for Website Uptime**

**(1)** From your home page, click on the _Monitors_ tab on the top

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nixstats\_9.png)

**(2)** In the _Overview_ tab, you can either create a new Monitor by selecting _Add Monitor_ or select an existing Monitor

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nixstats\_10.png)

**(3)** Click on the _Settings_ tab

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nixstats\_11.png)

**(4)** In the _Recipients_ tab, select Squadcast Webhook and select when the alert needs to be sent to Squadcast. Save/Update the set configuration

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nixstats\_12.png)

Now, every time there is an alert for your website in Nixstats, the alert will be sent to Squadcast and an incident will be triggered, notifying the right people. Similarly, if the alert gets resolved within Nixstats, it will get **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.

That is it, your integration is complete and you are good to go!
