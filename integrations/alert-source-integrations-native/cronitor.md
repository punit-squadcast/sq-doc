# Cronitor

[Cronitor](https://www.cronitor.io/) is a simple monitoring tool for every application that provides performance insights and uptime monitoring for cron jobs, websites and APIs.

Route detailed alerts from Cronitor to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Cronitor as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Cronitor** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Alert in Cronitor

**(1)** Login to your Cronitor dashboard. Head over to the **Settings** tab and click on **Alerts**

**(2)** Click on **Create Notification List**. Fill in the **Name**, **Unique Key** and paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook URL in the placeholder for **Webhook Endpoints**. Then click on **Save Notification List**

The created alert can then be added to **Jobs**, **Checks** & **Heartbeats**.

That's it, you are good to go! Your Cronitor integration is now complete. Whenever Cronitor fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. Also, when an alert is resolved in Cronitor, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
