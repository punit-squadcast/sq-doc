Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Azure monitor. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Azure Monitor as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Azure Monitor** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %} 
<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

## Create Squadcast Webhook in Azure

Login to your Azure account select your virtual machine. Under **Monitoring**, go to **Alerts**.

Then go to **Manage Actions** → **Add Action groups** → **Creatre action group** (Test grp or Squadcast webhook alerts) by selecting **Action type** as **Webhook**. Paste the squadcast webhook url from the previous step and make sure **Enable the common alert schema** toggle switch is turned on.

Go back to **Alerts** window and click **New Alert**. Specify Resource, Condition and under **Actions** select the action group (Test grp or Squadcast webhook alerts) you just made. Provide alert rule Name, Description and **Create Alert**.

Now whenever an alert is triggered by Azure Monitor, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast. 

The Azure Monitor integration comes with an **Auto-Resolve** feature, meaning that whenever the alerts gets resolved in Azure, the incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
