# Loggly

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Loggly. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using Loggly as an Alert Source in Squadcast

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Loggly** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Setting up a Squadcast Webhook in Loggly

Now log in to your Loggly account and click on "**Alerts**".

On the alerts page click on "**Alert Endpoints**" and then click on "**Create Endpoint**"

Select the type as "**HTTP Endpoint**", method as "**POST**" and enter the URL obtained earlier.

Enter the appropriate name and description for your endpoint and click on **Save**.

Now you can use this alert endpoint in any of yours alert configuration. Every time here an alert is triggered you will get a corresponding incident in squadcast.
