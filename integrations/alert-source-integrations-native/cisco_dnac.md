# Cisco DNAC

Cisco DNA Center is at the heart of Ciscoâ€™s intent-based network. Cisco DNA Center supports the expression of business intent for network use cases, such as base automation capabilities in the enterprise network. The Analytics and Assurance features of Cisco DNA Center provide end-to-end visibility into the network with full context through data and insights.

You can integrate Cisco DNAC with Squadcast and get those alerts into Squadcast and get notified based on your notification policies.

### Using Cisco DNAC as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Cisco DNAC** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook URL REST Endpoint in Cisco DNAC

Login to your Cisco DNAC dashboard and go to the **Platform** tab and click on **Bundles**.

Browse the bundles and click on the **Configure** button next to **Network Events for REST API Endpoint** or **SWIM Events for REST API Endpoint** depending on which event that you would like to be sent to Squadcast or you can do both if required.

Enter the **Instance Name** as **Squadcast** and paste the **Cisco DNAC Webhook URL** you got from the previous section inside **REST Endpoint** and use `admin` for both **Username** and **Password** and click the **Save** button.
