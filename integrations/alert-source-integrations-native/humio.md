# Humio

[Humio](https://www.humio.com/) is a modern log management tool with streaming observability and is built to ingest & retain streaming data as quickly as it arrives, regardless of volume.

Route detailed alerts from Humio to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Humio as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Humio** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Alert in Humio

**(1)** Login to your Humio dashboard. Head over to the **Alerts** tab. Then under **Actions**, click on **+ New Action**

**(2)** Select **Action Type** as **Webhook**. Put in the **Name**, select **Method** as **POST** and paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook URL in the placeholder for **Endpoint URL**. Paste the payload mentioned below under the **Message Body Template** box and save it

```json
{
    "repository": "{repo_name}",
    "timestamp": "{triggered_timestamp}",
    "alert": {
    "name": "{name}",
    "description": "{description}",
    "query": {
        "queryString": "{query_string} ",
        "end": "{query_time_end}",
        "start": "{query_time_start}"
    },
    "notifierID": "{action_id}",
    "id": "{id}"
    },
    "warnings": "{warnings}",
    "numberOfEvents": {event_count},
    "url": "{url}"
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
\*\*Note: Custom Defined Variables\*\*

Users can define custom variables under the **Message Body Template** box :

**{ "custom" : { "key" : "value" , . . . , "key" : "value" } }**

Replace the **\[key]** & **\[value]** with proper values and add at the end of the variables mentioned in **Step 2**. This is how it might look like.

**Eg. :**

```json
{
    "repository": "{repo_name}",
    "timestamp": "{triggered_timestamp}",
    "alert": {
    "name": "{name}",
    "description": "{description}",
    "query": {
        "queryString": "{query_string} ",
        "end": "{query_time_end}",
        "start": "{query_time_start}"
    },
    "notifierID": "{action_id}",
    "id": "{id}"
    },
    "warnings": "{warnings}",
    "numberOfEvents": {event_count},
    "url": "{url}",
    "custom" : {
        "key1" : "value1",
        "key2" : "value2",
        "key3" : "value3"
    }
}
```
{% endhint %}

**(3)** Now, click on **Alerts** and then on **+ New Alert**. Put in the **Name**, check the **Alert enabled** checkbox and create your **Query** accordingly. Then under **Actions**, click on the **+** icon and add the previously created action. Then click on **Create alert**

That's it, you are good to go! Your Humio integration is now complete. Whenever Humio fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it.
