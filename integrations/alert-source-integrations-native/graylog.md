# Graylog

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Graylog.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using Graylog as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Graylog** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook in Graylog

1. Login to your graylog web console and go to **Alert** tab on the top.
2. Click on **Notifications**.
3. Click on **Add new notification**.
4. Select **All messages** on **Notify on Stream**
5. Select **HTTP Alarm Callback** on **Notification type** and click on **Add alert notification**.
6. Give a title to the notification and put the Squadcast web hook url from the previous step on the url field and click on **Save**.

Now whenever an alert is triggered by Graylog, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast.
