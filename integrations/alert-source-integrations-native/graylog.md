Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Graylog.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Graylog as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

## Create a Squadcast Webhook in Graylog

1. Login to your graylog web console and go to **Alert** tab on the top.
2. Click on **Notifications**.
3. Click on **Add new notification**.
4. Select **All messages** on **Notify on Stream**
5. Select **HTTP Alarm Callback** on **Notification type** and click on **Add alert notification**.

Now whenever an alert is triggered by Graylog, an incident will be created automatically in Squadcast.
