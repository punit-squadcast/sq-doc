# SignalFx

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from SignalFx. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using SignalFx as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **SignalFx** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Setup alerts to send notification to Squadcast webhook

Go to your SignalFx dashboard and setup a detector for the metric for which you want to get alerts for.

Then create a **New Alert rule** for the detector and define Alert Signal, Alert condition, Alert settings and Alert message.

For **Alert recipients**, click on the **Add Recipient** button and then select **Webhook** and proceed to add a custom webhook.

In the custom **Webhook Notification**, under **URL**, add the SignalFx API URL that you have got from the previous step and click **Update** button and then click on **PROCEED TO ALERT ACTIVATION** button.

That's it! Now your SignalFx integration is good to go and whenever an alert is triggered in SignalFx, an incident will automatically get created in Squadcast.

The SignalFx Integration comes with an **Auto-Resolve** feature, meaning, when an alert goes under the threshold and gets resolved in SignalFx will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
