# Shortcut (Clubhouse)

This document will help you integrate Shortcut with Squadcast.

[Shortcut](https://shortcut.com/) (formerly Clubhouse) allows software teams to plan, collaborate, build, and measure success by bringing in the right team workflows.

Route detailed ticket alerts from Shortcut to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Shortcut with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Shortcut as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Shortcut** from the **Alert Source** drop-down menu and copy the Webhook

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Shortcut: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** Click on **Profile > Integrations**

That is it, you are now good to go! Whenever either of a Story or an Epic is created, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. When the Story or Epicis moved to the `Completed` state in Shortcut, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
