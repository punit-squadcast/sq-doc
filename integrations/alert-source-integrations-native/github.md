# GitHub

This document will help you integrate GitHub with Squadcast.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

Route detailed events from GitHub to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate GitHub with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using GitHub as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **GitHub** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In GitHub: Create a Squadcast Webhook

You can configure a webhook for a group or a project.

**(1)** Click on your user icon on the top right, under **Your repositories** or **Your organizations**, navigate to **Settings**

**(3)** Paste the previously copied Webhook from Squadcast into the **Payload URL** field, and select **Content type** as `application/json`

**(3)** In **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook** section, choose **Let me select individual events** and select the **below events** to trigger the Webhook. Next, click on **Add webhook**

* `Issues`
* `Pushes`
* `Pull Requests`
* `Releases`
* `Repository Vulnerability Alerts`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

This integration supports the below GitHub events:

* `Issues` (Supports auto-resolution)
* `Pushes`
* `Pull Requests` (Supports auto-resolution)
* `Releases`
* `Repository Vulnerability Alerts` (Supports auto-resolution)
{% endhint %}

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an Issue, Push, Pull Request or a Release event occurs in GitHub, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When an Issue or a Pull Request is closed in GitHub, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved** for it. However, for Pushes and Releases, users will have to manually resolve the associated incidents in Squadcast.
