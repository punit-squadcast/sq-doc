### How to integrate Freshservice with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Freshservice as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Freshservice** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_1.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Freshservice: Create a Squadcast webhook alert

**(1)** In the app, go to **Admin > Workflows Automator** to create the webhook

**(b)** Then, from the next drop-down, select **Trigger Webhook**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_7.png)

**(c)** Choose **Request Type** as `POST`

**(d)** In **Callback URL** paste the previously copied Squadcast webhook URL here

**(e)** Choose **Encoding** as `JSON` and `Simple`

**(f)** In **Content**, you can select all of the available fields to send complete information as the alert to Squadcast.

As the bare minimum, please select the below:

```json
ticket_status
ticket_id
ticket_priority
ticket_subject
ticket_due_by_time
ticket_description
ticket_source
ticket_department_name
ticket_category
ticket_url
ticket_portal_url

approval_portal_url
ticket_group_name
associated_asset_names
ticket_tags
ticket_agent_email
ticket_agent_name

```

**(g)** Then, click on **Done**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_8.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

The **Test Webhook** option sends empty data on the configured **Callback URL**. As a result, since no data is available in the alert payload, no incident is created in Squadcast for it. **Please create a test ticket post configuring this webhook as indicated in this document to see a test incident created for it in Squadcast**, to ensure that the configuration is working as expected.
{% endhint %}

**(6)** Click on **Activate**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_9.png)

**(7)** Do the following for sending **resolve alerts** to Squadcast:

**(a)** Follow steps **1-3**

**(b)** Fill in the form as shown in the screenshot below:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_10.png)

**(c)** Follow steps **5 and 6**

**(8)** Next, to create the alert, follow the steps below:

**(a)** Click on **âž•**(plus) icon and select any of the available options in the drop-down. Here, we have selected **Incident**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_11.png)

**(b)** Fill the form and click on **Save**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_12.png)

* **Status** `Open` -> **to trigger incident at Squadcast**
* **Status** `Resolved` -> **to resolve incident at Squadcast**
* **Status** `Closed` -> **to resolve incident at Squadcast**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

If you have configured [Custom Statuses](https://support.freshservice.com/support/solutions/articles/156452-customizing-helpdesk-statuses) in Freshservice and want to use one of the configured Custom Statuses for ticket creation/resolution (in turn, triggering/resolving corresponding incidents in Squadcast), kindly reach out to [support@squadcast.com](mailto:support@squadcast.com) for further details on this.
{% endhint %}

That is it, you are now good to go! Whenever a ticket is created with `Open` status, an incident will be created in Squadcast. When the ticket is either `Solved` or `Closed` in Freshservice, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
