{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i-md}}
**Note:**

The **Test Webhook** option sends empty data on the configured **Callback URL**. As a result, since no data is available in the alert payload, no incident is created in Squadcast for it. **Please create a test ticket post configuring this webhook as indicated in this document to see a test incident created for it in Squadcast**, to ensure that the configuration is working as expected.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**(6)** Click on **Activate**

![](../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_9.png)

**(7)** Do the following for sending **resolve alerts** to Squadcast:

**(a)** Follow steps **1-3**

**(b)** Fill in the form as shown in the screenshot below:

![](../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_10.png)

**(c)** Follow steps **5 and 6**

**(8)** Next, to create the alert, follow the steps below: 

**(a)** Click on **➕**(plus) icon and select any of the available options in the drop-down. Here, we have selected **Incident**

![](../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_11.png)

**(b)** Fill the form and click on **Save**

![](../.gitbook/assets/freshservice\_12.png)

- **Status** `Open` -> **to trigger incident at Squadcast**
- **Status** `Resolved` -> **to resolve incident at Squadcast**
- **Status** `Closed` -> **to resolve incident at Squadcast**

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i-md}}
**Note:**

If you have configured [Custom Statuses](https://support.freshservice.com/support/solutions/articles/156452-customizing-helpdesk-statuses) in Freshservice and want to use one of the configured Custom Statuses for ticket creation/resolution (in turn, triggering/resolving corresponding incidents in Squadcast), kindly reach out to <a href="mailto:support@squadcast.com">support@squadcast.com</a> for further details on this.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

That is it, you are now good to go! Whenever a ticket is created with `Open` status, an incident will be created in Squadcast. When the ticket is either `Solved` or `Closed` in Freshservice, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast as well.
