This document will help you integrate Logz.io with Squadcast.
 
[Logz.io](https://logz.io/) allows engineers to look into their stack with powerful log, metric, and tracing analytics based on the cloud-native tools they use. 
Route detailed monitoring alerts from Logz.io to the right users in Squadcast.

## How to integrate Logz.io with Squadcast

### In Squadcast: Using Logz.io as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{{site.data.alerts.yellow-note-i}}
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

{% raw %}
```json
{
    "alert_title": "{{alert_title}}",
    "alert_description": "{{alert_description}}",
    "alert_severity": "{{alert_severity}}",
    "account_id": "{{account_id}}",
    "account_name": "{{account_name}}",
    "alert_samples": "{{alert_samples}}",
    "alert_tags_json": "[{{alert_tags_json}}]"
}
```
{% endraw %}

**(4)** Next, to create the alert itself, you can either: 

- Go to **Alerts & Events > New Alert** or,
- Click on **Create Alert** from the **Kibana dashboard**

**(5)** Give the alert a **title**

Now, you will have to fill out the 3 sections:
    
(a) **Search for...** section:
    
- Either enter your **Search** query or verify that the query present is correct
- Choose to **Group By** certain fields
- Select **Accounts to Search**
- Choose to repeat this (by adding another query), join the queries, etc.

**(5)** (b) **Trigger if...** section:

- Add **Trigger conditions** for the alert and add one or more thresholds for the trigger

![](../.gitbook/assets/logzio\_7.png)

**(5)** (c) **Notify** section:

- Add a **Description** for the alert (which will be visible for these incidents in Squadcast)
- Associate **Tags** (if any)
- **Who to send it to** -> choose **Squadcast Webhook**
- Choose a **wait time** between notifications as needed
- **Output format** -> choose **JSON**
- You can choose to either send **all log fields** or **custom fields**

<b>FAQ:</b>
<br/><br/><p>Q: If an alert gets resolved in Logz.io, does Logz.io send auto-resolve signals to Squadcast?<br/><br/>A: No, Logz.io does not send auto-resolve signals to Squadcast. Hence, Squadcast incidents from Logz.io should be resolved manually.</p>
