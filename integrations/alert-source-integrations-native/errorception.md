<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
