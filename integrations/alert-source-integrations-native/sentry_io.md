Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Sentry.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using Sentry as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="warning" %} 
<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

## Create a Squadcast Callback in Sentry

**(1)** Now log in to your Sentry account and go to your **Project Settings**. Under **Alerts** section of the **Settings** tab, go to Integrations and select webhook. Under **Callback URLs**, Paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook URL
