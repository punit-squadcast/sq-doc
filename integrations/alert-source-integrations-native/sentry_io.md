# Sentry.io

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Sentry.

Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using Sentry as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Sentry** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Callback in Sentry

**(1)** Now log in to your Sentry account and go to your **Project Settings**. Under **Alerts** section of the **Settings** tab, go to Integrations and select webhook. Under **Callback URLs**, Paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook URL

When all of these conditions are met: An event is seen

That's it! Your Sentry integration is now good to go.
