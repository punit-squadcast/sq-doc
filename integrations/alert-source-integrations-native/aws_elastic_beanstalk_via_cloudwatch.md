This document will help you integrate AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Squadcast.

[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger and IIS.<br/>
Route detailed monitoring alerts from AWS Elastic Beanstalk via CloudWatch to the right users in Squadcast.

<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
