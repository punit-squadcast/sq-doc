# Crowdstrike Falcon

[Crowdstrike Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-platform/) helps to secure the most critical areas of enterprise risk â€“ endpoints, cloud workloads, identities, and data.

Route detailed alerts from Crowdstrike Falcon to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Crowdstrike Falcon as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Crowdstrike Falcon** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook URL REST Endpoint in Crowdstrike Falcon

**(1)** Login to your Crowdstrike Falcon dashboard. Head over to **Workflows**

Again add a **condition** after the **Trigger** event. Choose Parameter as **Detection status** or **Incident status**, Operator as **is equal to** & Value as **Closed**. Then click on **+** and add **Action**. Choose **Notifications** as **Action type** and **Call webhook** as **Action**.

That's it, you are good to go! Your Crowdstrike Falcon integration is now complete. Whenever Crowdstrike Falcon fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. Also, when an status has changed to **Closed**, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
