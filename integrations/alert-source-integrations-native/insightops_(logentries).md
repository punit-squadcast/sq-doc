Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from insightOps.
 
Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

## Using InsighOps as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **InsightOps** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="info" %} 
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

Now log in to your insightOps account and go to alerts.

Click on "**Add Tag/Alert**".

Fill in all the details in the dialog box and for the "**Send to**" field select "**Web Hook**" and enter the URL obtained earlier.
