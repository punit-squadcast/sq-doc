# Redash

This document will help you integrate Redash with Squadcast.

[Redash](https://redash.io/product/) gives you the power to enjoy the comfort of Redash's database query editor with powerful collaboration, create and visualize dashboards and set up alerts to get notified for certain events on your data.

Route detailed events from Redash to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Redash with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Redash as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Redash** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

![](../../.gitbook/assets/redash\_1.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Redash: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** From the Home Page, navigate to **Settings** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the menu bar

**(9)** Next:

* In either case, fill in all the necessary details for the **Query Name** and **Trigger When** fields
* Select the option suitable for you from the **When triggered, send notification** dropdown (typically, you should be selecting **Just Once** so that you do not get bombarded with alert notifications)
* In the **Template** dropdown, select **Custom template**
* In the **Subject** section, add the below as is:

```json
[{{ALERT_STATUS}}] {{ALERT_NAME}}
```

* In the **Body** section, add the below as is:

```json
**Query Name**: {{QUERY_NAME}}
### Additional Information
[Alert URL]({{ALERT_URL}})
[Query URL]({{QUERY_URL}})
```

![](../../.gitbook/assets/redash\_10.png)

* Then, click on **Create Alert**

**(10)** Once the Alert has been added, select the newly added Alert in the list

![](../../.gitbook/assets/redash\_11.png)

**(11)** Click on **Add** against **Destinations**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/redash\_12.png)

**(12)** Here, select the newly added Webhook, **Squadcast Webhook**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/redash\_13.png)

**(13)** Ensure that the Webhook has been enabled for it and is being displayed as one of the Destinations for the Alert

![](../../.gitbook/assets/redash\_14.png)

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an Alert is created in Redash, an incident would be created in Squadcast. When the Alert is resolved in Redash, the corresponding incident in Squadcast will be **automatically resolved**.
