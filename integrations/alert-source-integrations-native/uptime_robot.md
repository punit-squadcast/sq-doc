# Uptime Robot

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Uptime Robot and Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using Uptime Robot as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Uptime Robot** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create Squadcast webhook in Uptime Robot dashboard

Go to your Uptime Robot dashboard and select **My Settings** and click on **Add Alert Contact** button in the **Alert Contact** tab.

In the **New Alert Contact** page, Add the contact information as below.

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Alert Contact Type       | Webhook                                            |
| Friendly Name            | Squadcast                                          |
| URL to Notify            | URL from the previous step and append ? to the end |
| Enable Notifications for | Up & down events                                   |

For **POST Value (JSON Format)**, please paste the below JSON and make sure the **Send as JSON** checkbox is ticked and click **Create Alert Contact** button.

```json
{
	"monitorID": "*monitorID*",
	"monitorURL": "*monitorURL*",
	"monitorFriendlyName": "*monitorFriendlyName*",
	"alertType": "*alertType*",

In the **Edit Alert Contact** window, make sure the **Send as JSON** and **Send default variables as POST parameters** check boxes are ticked and the **Send default variables** as a query string checkbox is unchecked and click **Save** changes

Then you can add the Alert contact to any monitor and whenever an alert is fired, an incident will get triggered in Squadcast. This integration comes with an **Auto-Resolve** feature, meaning, when the alert get resolved in Uptime Robot, it gets resolved in Squadcast as well.
