# Rapid7 InsightIDR

This document will help you integrate Rapid7 InsightIDR with Squadcast.

[Rapid7 InsightIDR](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightidr/) is your security center for incident detection and response, authentication monitoring, and endpoint visibility. InsightIDR identifies unauthorized access from external and internal threats and highlights suspicious activity so you donâ€™t have to weed through thousands of data streams.

Route detailed monitoring alerts from Rapid7 InsightIDR to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Rapid7 InsightIDR with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Rapid7 InsightIDR as an Alert Source

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Rapid7 InsightIDR: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**Configure your** [**Universal Webhook Data Exporter**](https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/webhook/#section-how-to-configure-this-data-exporter)

**(1)** From your InsightIDR dashboard, select **Data Collection** on the left hand menu

**(2)** When the **Data Collection** page appears, click the **Setup Event Source** drop-down and choose **Add Event Source**

**(3)** From the **Security Data** section, click the **Data Exporter** icon

The **Add Event Source** panel appears

* Choose your **Collector** and select **Universal Webhook** for **Data Exporter**. Give the Event Source a meaningful name
* Paste the previously copied Squadcast URL under **URL**
