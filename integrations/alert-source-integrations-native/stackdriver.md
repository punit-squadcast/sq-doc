{% hint style="info" %} 
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>

<b>FAQ:</b>
<br/><br/><p>Q: Does this integration support auto-resolution of incidents in Squadcast?<br/><br/>
A: Yes, this integration **supports auto-resolution of incidents in Squadcast**, meaning that whenever alerts get resolved in Stackdriver, the corresponding incidents will be automatically resolved in Squadcast as well. If you do not enable the checkbox to <b>recieve Incident Resolution signals</b>, then your Squadcast incidents will not be auto-resolved when alerts in Stackdriver are resolved.</p>
