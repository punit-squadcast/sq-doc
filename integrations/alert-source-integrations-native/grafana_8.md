# Grafana 8

This document will help you integrate [Grafana 8](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-0/) with Squadcast.

Grafana is a data visualization platform that allows you to query, visualize and alert on metrics no matter where they are stored.

Route detailed alerts from Grafana 8 to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Grafana 8 with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Grafana 8 as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Grafana 8** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Grafana 8: Create a Squadcast Webhook as a Notification Channel

**(1)** Login to your Grafana 8 dashboard, click on the **Alerting (Bell)** icon and select **Contact points**

**(3)** Enter `Name` as **Squadcast**, under `Contact point type`- select **Webhook** and under `URL`, paste the previously copied Webhook URL from Squadcast

**(4)** Click on **Save** to enable the integration. You can test the integration by clicking on **Test**. This will trigger a test incident in Squadcast

Now, whenever an alert is triggered in Grafana 8, an incident will be created in Squadcast. When an alert is resolved in Grafana 8, the corresponding incident will automatically get resolved in Squadcast, provided the **Disable Resolve Message** checkbox is **unchecked**.
