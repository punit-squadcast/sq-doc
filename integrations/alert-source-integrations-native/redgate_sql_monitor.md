# Redgate SQL Monitor

[Redgate SQL Monitor](https://www.red-gate.com/) is a database monitoring software used to easily monitor cloud or on premises SQL-based databases.

Route detailed alerts from Redgate SQL Monitor to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Redgate SQL Monitor as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Redgate SQL Monitor** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Alert in Redgate SQL Monitor

**(1)** Login to your Redgate SQL Monitor dashboard. Head over to the **Configuration** tab. Then under **Alerts and Metrics**, select **Notification settings**

**(3)** You can choose to send the **Default message** itself by selecting the radio button. Paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook URL in the placeholder for **URL**.

You can also click on **Preview and test** to test the alert. This will create a test incident in Squadcast.

That's it, you are good to go! Your Redgate SQL Monitor integration is now complete. Whenever Redgate SQL Monitor fires an alert with **Status : Raised** or **Escalated**, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. Also, when an alert status has changed to **Ended** in Redgate SQL Monitor, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
