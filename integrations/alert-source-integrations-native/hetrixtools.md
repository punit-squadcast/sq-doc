# HetrixTools

This document will help you integrate HetrixTools with Squadcast.

[HetrixTools](https://hetrixtools.com/) allows you to monitor all of your IP addresses and Domain Names, to help you quickly find the malware source and immediately begin the delisting process before it affects your clients and your reputation. Route detailed monitoring alerts from HetrixTools to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate HetrixTools with Squadcast

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In HetrixTools: Create a Squadcast Webhook

**(1)** From the dashboard, click on your **\<username>** which is at the top-right corner. From the drop-down, select **Contact Lists**

A: Auto-resolution of incidents in Squadcast is only supported for Uptime Monitor, and _not_ for the Blacklist Monitor and the Server Monitor Resource Usage at this time.
