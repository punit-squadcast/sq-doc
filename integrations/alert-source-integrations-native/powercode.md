{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Alert in Powercode

**(1)** Login to your Powercode dashboard. Head over to the **Configuration** tab. Then under **System Configuration**, select **Web Hooks**

**(2)** Select an event under the **Event** drop down, and paste the previously copied Squadcast Webhook URL in the placeholder for **Destination URL**. Then click on **Add Web Hook**
