This document will help you integrate PRTG Network Monitor with Squadcast.

[PRTG Network Monitor](https://www.paessler.com/prtg) by Paessler is a tool used to monitor small and midsize infrastructures. It provides maps and dashboards, flexible alerting, multiple user interfaces and distributed monitoring.

Route detailed alerts from PRTG Network Monitor to the right users in Squadcast.

## Using PRTG Network Monitor as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

{% hint style="info" %} 
<b>Important</b><br/><br/>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

**Note:**

By default, the **SNI** field is set to **Do not send SNI (default)**. Ideally, this setting should work fine. However, we have seen that certain users of PRTG Network Monitor receive SSL Handshake related errors. In such cases, you can simply change the setting here to **Send SNI**. 

Then specify the **app.squadcast.com** as the **SNI Name**.

Doing so will solve for any SSL related errors that occur otherwise.
{% endhint %}

**(5)** Finally click on the **Create** button to create the Notification Template

Now, your Squadcast webhook is setup and ready to be consumed by sensors for sending alerts. 

Simply select the **Squadcast Webhook** as the Notification Template from the dropdown when configuring Notification Triggers in order to send notifications to Squadcast.

That is it, you are good to go! Everytime an alert is generated in PRTG Network Monitor, an incident for it would be triggered in Squadcast. When the alert is resolved in PRTG Network Monitor (when the system gets back online), the corresponding incident for it will be automatically resolved in Squadcast.
