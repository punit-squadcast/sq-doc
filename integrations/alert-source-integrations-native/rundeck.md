# Rundeck

[Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/) is an automation tool that helps you to make existing automation, scripts, and commands more secure, auditable, and easier to run.

Route detailed alerts from Rundeck to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Rundeck as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Rundeck** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Notification in Rundeck

**(1)** Login to your Rundeck dashboard and head over to the **JOBS** section. You can either create a new Job or edit an existing one

**(a)** To create a new job, click on **Job Actions**. Then click on **New Job**

That's it, you are good to go! Your Rundeck integration is now complete. Whenever Rundeck fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. Also, when a job is completed in Rundeck, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
