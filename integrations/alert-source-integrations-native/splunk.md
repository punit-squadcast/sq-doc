# Splunk

This document will help you integrate Splunk with Squadcast.

Splunk is used to search, analyze and visualize the machine-generated data gathered from the websites, applications, sensors, devices etc. which make up your IT infrastructure and business. Route detailed event information from Splunk to the right users in Squadcast.

### How to integrate Splunk with Squadcast

#### In Squadcast: Using Splunk as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Splunk** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

#### In Splunk: Create a Squadcast webhook alert

**(1)** In the Splunk dashboard, click on **Search & Reporting** under **Apps**

**(4)** Under **Trigger Actions**, click on **Add Actions** and select **Webhook**

**(5)** Paste the copied webhook URL from Squadcast under **URL** and click on **Save**

That's it! Your Splunk Integration is now complete. Whenever an alert is fired for your search query, an incident will be created in Squadcast.
