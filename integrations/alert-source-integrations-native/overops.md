# OverOps

Follow the steps below to configure a service so as to extract its related alert data from Splunk. Squadcast will then process this information to create incidents for this service as per your preferences.

### Using OverOps as an Alert Source in Squadcast

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **OverOps** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook alert in OverOps

In your OverOps dashboard, click on the **Settings** icon, select **Alerts** and then select the **Webhooks** tab.
