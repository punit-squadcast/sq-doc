# Honeycomb

[Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/) is an application monitoring tool that helps DevOps and SRE teams to operate more efficiently by offering rich observability and intuitive team collaboration.

Route detailed alerts from Honeycomb to the right users in Squadcast.

### Using Honeycomb as an Alert Source

**(1)** From the navigation bar on the left, select **Services**. Pick the applicable **Team** from the Team-picker on the top. Next, click on **Alert Sources** for the applicable Service

**(2)** Search for **Honeycomb** from the Alert Source drop-down and copy the Webhook URL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Create a Squadcast Webhook Trigger in Honeycomb

**(1)** Login to your Honeycomb dashboard. Head over to the **Account** settings and click on **Team settings**

That's it, you are good to go! Your Honeycomb integration is now complete. Whenever Honeycomb fires an alert, an incident will be created in Squadcast for it. Also, when an alert is resolved in Honeycomb, the corresponding incident gets **auto-resolved** in Squadcast.
