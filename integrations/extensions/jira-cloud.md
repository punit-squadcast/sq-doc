# Jira Cloud

Create tickets in Jira with the incidents from Squadcast and sync status bidirectionally

You can use this integration guide to install and configure the Squadcast extension in Jira Cloud to _create issues in Jira projects_ when there is an incident in Squadcast either _Automatically_ or _Manually_ and _sync the status bidirectionally_.

### Pre-requisites <a href="#pre-requisites" id="pre-requisites"></a>

* A valid Squadcast cloud subscription or a trial account (in either the Pro or Enterprise [plans](https://squadcast.com/pricing))
* A user account in Jira Cloud version with `Administrator` privileges
* Only the Account Owner and Users with the `Manage Extensions` permission will be able to enable, disable and manage Extensions in Squadcast

### Configuring the Extension <a href="#configuring-the-extension" id="configuring-the-extension"></a>

#### In Jira Cloud: Installing Squadcast App <a href="#in-jira-cloud-installing-squadcast-app" id="in-jira-cloud-installing-squadcast-app"></a>

**(1)** Login to your Jira Cloud account and install the Squadcast Jira Cloud plugin corresponding to your data centre.

Plugin for the US data center - [Squadcast Jira Cloud plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221041/squadcast-for-jira-cloud?hosting=cloud\&tab=overview)

Plugin for the EU data center - [Squadcast for Jira Cloud (EU only version)](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1227594/squadcast-for-jira-cloud-eu-only-version?tab=overview\&hosting=cloud)

**(2)** Click on **Configure** once the app has been installed

**(3)** Copy the `Jira Client Token` that is available in _Step 2_ of the _Configuration page_

#### In Squadcast: Configuring Jira Cloud Extension <a href="#in-squadcast-configuring-jira-cloud-extension" id="in-squadcast-configuring-jira-cloud-extension"></a>

This would be the global configuration for the Jira Cloud extension. After configuring the same, you can map a particular Jira Cloud project to one or more Squadcast Services by following the steps [here](broken-reference).

**(1)** In Squadcast, navigate to **Settings** and select the **Extensions** tab from the left navigation sidebar

**(2)** Move over to the Jira Cloud extension and click on **Integrate**

**(3)** Paste the previously copied `Jira Client Token` and click on **Save & Next**

**(4)** Select the `Jira Project` in which tickets need to be created, select the `Issue Type` and click **Next**

**(5)** Then, map the `Jira Issue Status` to the available _Squadcast incident statuses_ and click **Next**

**(6)** Select the **Mode** in which you want to add tickets to Jira for incidents in Squadcast: **Manually** or **Automatically** and then, select the _Service(s)_, for whose incidents Jira tickets must be created by Squadcast and click on **Save & Integrate**

Thatâ€™s it! Your Jira Cloud integration is good to go.

### Usage of the Automatic and Manual Modes <a href="#usage-of-the-automatic-and-manual-modes" id="usage-of-the-automatic-and-manual-modes"></a>

#### Automatic mode <a href="#automatic-mode" id="automatic-mode"></a>

If you have chosen the **Automatic mode** while configuring Jira cloud then you need not do anything. Any incident triggered for the selected Service(s) will automatically _create an issue_ in the _selected Jira Project_ with the _configured Issue Type_.

#### Manual mode <a href="#manual-mode" id="manual-mode"></a>

If **Manual Mode** is chosen, follow the below steps to create a ticket in Jira:

**(1)** Open the incident in Squadcast and click on **More Actions** button in the **Incident Details** page

**(2)** Select **Jira Cloud** action and click on **Create a ticket in Jira**

A ticket will be created in the _selected Jira Project_ with the _configured Issue Type_. This action will be recorded in the _Incident Timeline with a hyperlink to the created Jira ticket_.

### Configuring a Jira Project for each Squadcast Service <a href="#configuring-a-jira-project-for-each-squadcast-service" id="configuring-a-jira-project-for-each-squadcast-service"></a>

If you would like for tickets to be created for incidents of each Service in a different Jira Project, you can configure so within the Services page.

**(1)** For a Service, click the **More** options

**(2)** Select **Jira Cloud Project**

**(3)** Here, map the _Jira Project_ of your choice and select the required _Type_

**(4)** Next, you can choose to either create tickets **Manually** or **Automatically** for the Service in the previously selected Project. Additionally, you can map the available Project **Status** to the incident states in Squadcast - `Triggered`, `Acknowledged`, `Resolved`. Then, click **Save**

If you configure a Jira Cloud Project for a Service, this setting will override the previously configured Jira Cloud Extensions settings (the global configuration in Settings > Extensions > Jira Cloud).
