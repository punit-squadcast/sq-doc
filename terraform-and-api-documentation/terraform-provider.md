# Terraform Provider

This release helps you configure services in Squadcast with ease. This is under active development and weâ€™ll add more functionality as we go.

You can find it for us in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/search/providers?q=squadcast) and go over the [Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SquadcastHub/squadcast/latest/docs) to start using this.
