<b>Important</b>
<p>For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a <b>green dot - Receiving alerts</b> against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.</p>
<p>An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.</p>
{% endhint %}

### In Kapacitor: Setup a Squadcast Webhook

**Method 1: Configuring Squadcast Webhook through Chronograf**

**(1)** From your Chronograf account, hover over the *Alerts* icon in the side bar, and select *Manage Tasks*

**(4)** Click on *Save Rule*

**Method 2: Configure Squadcast Webhook in kapacitor.conf and use the endpoint in TICKscript** 

**(1)** Within kapacitor.conf, scroll to `[[httppost]]` and paste the following:

```
endpoint = "squadcast"
url = "<Copied_Webhook_URL_from_Squadcast"
headers = { Content-Type = "application/json" }
```

**(2)** Go to your TICKscript, within *alert* context, set up a [post call to the above configured endpoint](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.5/event_handlers/post/#example-tickscript-using-a-pre-configured-endpoint)

{% hint style="warning" %}
<b>Pro Tip:</b>
<p>In Mac OS, Kapacitor's configuration file is generally in <code class="highlighter-rouge" style="color: #c7254e; background-color: #f9f2f4 !important;">/usr/local/etc/kapacitor.conf</code> and in Linux machines, it generally is in <code class="highlighter-rouge" style="color: #c7254e; background-color: #f9f2f4 !important;">/etc/kapacitor.conf</code></p>
{% endhint %}

That is it, you are now good to go! 

Whenever an alert is generated in Kapacitor, an incident is triggered for it in Squadcast. When the alert recovers in Kapacitor, the corresponding incident will be **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.
