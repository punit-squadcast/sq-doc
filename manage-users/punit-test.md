{% hint style="info" %}
**Important**

For an Alert Source to turn active (indicated by a **green dot - Receiving alerts** against the name of the Alert Source in the drop-down), you can either generate a test alert or wait for a real-time alert to be generated by the Alert Source.

An Alert Source is active if there is a recorded incident via that Alert Source for the Service in the last 30 days.

## In Kapacitor: Setup a Squadcast Webhook

**Method 1: Configuring Squadcast Webhook through Chronograf**

**(1)** From your Chronograf account, hover over the _Alerts_ icon in the side bar, and select _Manage Tasks_

**(2)** You can either modify an existing _Alert Rule_ or create one by selecting _Add Alert Rule_

![](../.gitbook/assets/kapacitor\_3.png)

**(3)** Within the _Alert Rule Builder_, give the Alert Rule a _Name_, select _Alert Type_, _Time Series_, _Conditions_

Scroll further to _Alert Handlers_

(a) Select _post_ from the drop down

**(3)** (b) Paste the Webhook copied from Squadcast under _HTTP endpoint for POST request_

**(4)** Click on _Save Rule_

**Method 2: Configure Squadcast Webhook in kapacitor.conf and use the endpoint in TICKscript**

**(1)** Within kapacitor.conf, scroll to `[[httppost]]` and paste the following:

```
endpoint = "squadcast"
url = "<Copied_Webhook_URL_from_Squadcast"
headers = { Content-Type = "application/json" }
```

**(2)** Go to your TICKscript, within _alert_ context, set up a [post call to the above configured endpoint](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.5/event\_handlers/post/#example-tickscript-using-a-pre-configured-endpoint)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Pro Tip:**

In Mac OS, Kapacitor's configuration file is generally in `/usr/local/etc/kapacitor.conf` and in Linux machines, it generally is in `/etc/kapacitor.conf`
{% endhint %}

That is it, you are now good to go!

Whenever an alert is generated in Kapacitor, an incident is triggered for it in Squadcast. When the alert recovers in Kapacitor, the corresponding incident will be **auto-resolved** in Squadcast as well.
