**Note:**

To import multiple users to your Organization in one go, you can simply drag and drop a `.csv` file or, click on `select a file from your computer` on the top of the page to bulk import users. More information on this is available [here](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/import-users).
{% endhint %}

If one wants to view the **Profile** of another user added in the Organization, for the added user, click on the More Option and select **View Profile** to do so.

* The invited user will receive an email for verification. Until the user has been successfully verified, you will notice an icon indicating that <mark style="color:red;">`Verification Is Pending`</mark> against that User.
* You can choose to resend the verification email by clicking on the <mark style="color:red;">`Verification Is Pending`</mark> icon should that be necessary. Please ensure that you check not only your _Inbox_, but also _Spam_ or _Promotions_ folders to ensure the verification email ended up landing there.

**Note:**

You cannot change or transfer the Account Ownership using this _Add Users_ flow. This needs to be done after the users have been imported.
