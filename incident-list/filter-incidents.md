#### Date & Time <a href="#date--time" id="date--time"></a>

This filter allows you to filter down incidents to a **specific time range**. By default, the incidents within the last **30 days** are displayed. Change the filter by choosing a different option.

**Custom Range**

This option allows you to give a custom time range within which you would like to view your incidents. Here, you can also select the exact time with which you would like to filter by.

**Note:** You will be limited to choose the custom time range here based on the [plan](https://squadcast.com/pricing) that you are currently on (data retention by the plan).

#### Service <a href="#service" id="service"></a>

Filter incidents by **Services**.

You can choose to filter by multiple Services, so use the checkbox to select all the Services. You can also use the search box to narrow down your options.

Filter incidents by **Alert Sources**.
