# Service Dependency Based Deduplication

Service Dependency Based Deduplication works on the logic that the incidents coming in for a Service and its dependencies have a related cause.

It is most likely the case where, when one Service has an incident, it's dependent Service(s) may also have incidents and hence, you will be notified of the incident only once. _This helps control unnecessary alert noise and notification fatigue during critical outages_.

Defining dependencies between Services also helps Squadcast understand the relationship between your actual systems.

To understand this better, let us consider 3 Services: _Service A_, _Service B_ and _Service C_.

If _Service A_ is <mark style="color:red;">`dependent on`</mark> _Service B_ and _Service C_, then:

* **Dependent Service**: _Service A_
* **Dependency Service(s)**: _Service B_, _Service C_

Letâ€™s say, _Service B_ has an open incident at _time x_ and _Service C_ has an open incident at _time x+1_. Now, _Service A_ receives an incident. This incident for _Service A_ gets deduplicated with the **latest** open incident of its dependency Service(s) - i.e., with the open incident for _Service C_, in this case.

### Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

The User Role associated with the user in the Team must have required permissions to manage Services (ability to manage Deduplication Rules).

### Adding a Service Dependency <a href="#adding-a-service-dependency" id="adding-a-service-dependency"></a>

Ensure that the right Team is chosen from the team picker on the top of the screen.

1\. Click on **Services** in the primary navigation

2\. To add a dependency where, _Service A_ <mark style="color:red;">`is dependent on`</mark> Service B, for _Service A_, click on the **More options** icon and select **Dependencies**

3\. Search for _Service B_, select it and click on **Save**

In this example, we have considered <mark style="color:red;">`Backend Prometheus Service`</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">`Translations`</mark> Services as dependencies of the <mark style="color:red;">`Payment Portal`</mark> Service.

This means that the <mark style="color:red;">`Payment Portal`</mark> Service is dependent on <mark style="color:red;">`Backend Prometheus`</mark>` ```` `<mark style="color:red;">`Service`</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">`Translations`</mark>.

### Enabling Service Dependency Based Deduplication <a href="#enabling-service-dependency-based-deduplication" id="enabling-service-dependency-based-deduplication"></a>

Once you have defined the Service Dependencies, you can set a Service Dependency Based Deduplication rule which would deduplicate all incoming alerts for the chosen Service against the latest open incident of its Service Dependencies.

To do so:

1\. For the Service that has its dependencies defined, click on **More** and select **Deduplication Rules**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/service-dependancy-based-deduplication\_3.png)

2\.  For the Deduplication Rule that you want to be checked and applied for Service Dependency Based Deduplication, simply enable the checkbox **If this service and service depend on both having an incident, alert only once**.

**Note:** This checkbox for every Deduplication Rule is disabled by default.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**

1. The Service Dependency Based Deduplication will deduplicate any incoming alert against either a <mark style="color:red;">`Triggered`</mark> or <mark style="color:red;">`Acknowledged`</mark> incident only.
2. Service Dependency-based Deduplication is rule-specific and can be enabled for any number of Deduplication Rules that are defined for a Service.

### Enabling Service Dependency Based Deduplication for a Specific Service Dependency <a href="#enabling-service-dependency-based-deduplication-for-a-specific-service-dependency" id="enabling-service-dependency-based-deduplication-for-a-specific-service-dependency"></a>

In cases where you would like Squadcast to consider just one of the many dependencies for a Service for Service Dependency Based Deduplication, you can follow the method below.

Along with enabling the Service Dependency checkbox, as shown above, you will need to add the below condition to the rule:

<mark style="color:red;">`past_incident.service == <slug_of_the_particular_dependency_service>`</mark>

### FAQs <a href="#faqs" id="faqs"></a>

1\. Where can one find the <mark style="color:red;">`slug`</mark> of a Service?

The <mark style="color:red;">`slug`</mark> of a Service is displayed on the Service card as shown below.

2\. Can I set up dependencies between Services that are in 2 different Teams?

No, you can set up dependencies only within Services for a given Team and not across Teams.
