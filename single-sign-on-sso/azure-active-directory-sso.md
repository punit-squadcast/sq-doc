# Azure Active Directory SSO

Squadcast supports SAML 2.0-based Single Sign-On (SSO) login for Azure Active Directory users. You can integrate your Squadcast Organization with your Azure Active Directory SSO by following this integration guide.

#### Pre-requisites <a href="#pre-requisites" id="pre-requisites"></a>

1. Account Owner / Administrator account in Squadcast
2. A valid Squadcast subscription in either ([Pro or Enterprise plans](https://www.squadcast.com/pricing))

{% hint style="info" %}
**Point to Note:**

1\. Only an Administrator / Account owner can enable and configure Azure Active Directory SSO for an Organisation in Squadcast.\
\
2\. Once enabled, only the Account Owner can use email-password-based login **by default** although, it can be configured to enable email-password-based login for Administrators as well.
