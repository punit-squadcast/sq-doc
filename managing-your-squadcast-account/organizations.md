# Organizations

In Squadcast, **Organizations** are the account identifying entity. You can name your organization to reflect the name of the organization you work for, the team that you are a part of or any other relevant name that reflects the purpose of the account.

### How many Organizations can I create? <a href="#how-many-organizations-can-i-create" id="how-many-organizations-can-i-create"></a>

You can create as many Organizations as you want. However, the system recognizes each organization as a separate account. Hence, you will be billed separately for each organization.

**Who can create a new Organization?**

Any user role in Squadcast can create a new Organization. The user that creates the new Organization will automatically be the Account Owner for the created Organization.
{% endhint %}

### Can users in my other Organization see a new Organization and its configuration? <a href="#can-users-in-my-other-organization-see-the-new-organization-and-its-configuration" id="can-users-in-my-other-organization-see-the-new-organization-and-its-configuration"></a>

Even if you are a part of multiple organizations, no one else but users added to each organization will have access to that particular organization.
