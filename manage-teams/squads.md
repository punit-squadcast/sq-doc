# Squads

Squads are smaller groups of members within Teams. Squads could correspond to groups of people that are responsible for specific projects within a Team.c

These are especially useful for adding groups of people to be on-call in a [Schedule](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/schedules). Squads are also handy when you need to notify the entire group together. For instance, when co-ordinated responses are required for high-urgency, high-complexity incidents, or as the last level of notification in an [Escalation Policy](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/escalation-policies) when an incident is still un-acknowledged at that point.
