# Role Based Access Control

Roles are a _set of permissions_ granted that are specific to the Team that the user is a member of. There are pre-defined Roles that can be directly assigned to the members of the Team. If one wants to define [Custom Roles](broken-reference/), that is also doable.

It is critical to thoroughly note that **Roles are Team-specific**, that is, **Roles will allow you specific abilities for just that Team that you are a part of**.

### Default Types of Roles and Abilities <a href="#default-types-of-roles-and-abilities" id="default-types-of-roles-and-abilities"></a>

There are 4 different default Roles that can be assigned to a Team member in Squadcast. See below to understand what they are, along with their abilities.

### 1. Manage Teams <a href="#1-manage-teams" id="1-manage-teams"></a>

This Role will allow you to manage just this Team. The abilities are:

| Entity | Abilities                |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| Teams  | `read` `update` `delete` |

### 2. Admin <a href="#2-admin" id="2-admin"></a>

| Entity              | Abilities                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Escalation Policies | `create` `read` `update` `delete` |
| Postmortems         | `create` `read` `update` `delete` |
| Runbooks            | `create` `read` `update` `delete` |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Roles are Team specific, i.e. roles will allow you specific abilities for just that team that youâ€™re a part of.
{% endhint %}

### Custom Roles <a href="#custom-roles" id="custom-roles"></a>

There might be situations where the predefined _Roles and Abilities_ available for members of a Team in Squadcast, by default, are not sufficient or that they do not align with how you want your Team members to be organized (in terms of Access Controls).

In such situations, you can either choose to modify one of the default Roles itself or you can create **Custom Roles** to provide special, customised permissions to specific types of users in your Organization for that Team.

It is critical to thoroughly note that only members of the Team with **Manage Team** Role permissions can create and manage **Custom Roles**.

### Creating a Custom Role <a href="#creating-a-custom-role" id="creating-a-custom-role"></a>

Follow the steps below to create a Custom Role for a Team:

1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/add\_and\_delete\_users\_1 (1) (1) (1) (8).png>)
