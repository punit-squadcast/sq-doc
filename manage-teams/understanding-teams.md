# Understanding Teams

Most organizations are divided into various different operational units. This is typically done to allow them to manage, design and increase the efficiency of their business operations to meet their internal requirements. Some are organized by technical specializations, others by activities, some by services, by geography, or any combination of those (or others). Whichever structure the organization chooses, these operational units remain responsible for the problems which occur in their own environments.

Having Teams is a way for customers to represent their organizational structure. The number of Teams that can be created per Organization is based on our [Pricing Plans](https://squadcast.com/pricing).
