1. If the Team member to be removed is a part of any of the entities (Incidents, Escalation Policies, Schedules) that belong to the Team, a modal displaying those details will appear
2. Now, select the Team member who will replace the one who is being removed using the available drop-down

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** For incidents, there are 2 options:

* If the checkbox is left **unchecked**, all the incidents assigned to the member being removed will be reassigned to the replacing Team member. The replacing Team member will receive **one** Email notification notifying them of the incidents that are now assigned to them
* If the checkbox is **checked**, all the **open** incidents (incidents in the `Triggered` and `Acknowledged` states) assigned to the member being removed will be suppressed
{% endhint %}

7\. Once the appropriate replacement Team member is selected and an action for incidents is determined, click on **Swap & Remove**

8\. A success modal confirming the swap will appear, like in the screenshot below

In addition to this, if a user also needs to be deleted from the Organization, please follow the steps [here](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/add-and-delete-users#delete-users) to do so.
